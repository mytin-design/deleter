Bug del001 arising;

When we add another note, the deleted note disappears;

How do we make a note in the deleted section stay there forever

//okay whats happenning ---
-every value passed through the input is stored in the variable pcom1

Therefore, how can we put every value in a new variable;


//Suggested strategy
list the values in an array;
use array.pop(), etc functions to add or delete items from array
